## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify facial expressions as either happy or sad. It utilizes TensorFlow for model development, OpenCV for image processing, and Kaggle datasets for training data.

## Installation

To run the Happy-Sad Face Classifier, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
!pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib kagglehub
